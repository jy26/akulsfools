        <h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
		<div class = "middle-column">
			<p>	We are determined to help keep streams clean and maintain stream health to provide clean water for humans and aquatic ecosystems. Many impoverished countries have no method of measuring their stream quality and no way of cleaning their dirty water. Our team has researched various modern technologies that solve these problems. There are many methods of determining stream health, yet no one has condensed the programs into one easy-to-use website or app. At the moment, we have developed a website to assist anyone interested to determine the quality of streams in their area. Using the Macroinvertebrate Multimetric Index (MMI), we have a calculator which accurately determines the health of a stream given a sample of macroinvertebrates. Along with the website, we have developed a filter that can be used in impoverished countries. Many developing countries lack clean drinking water, so a cheap filter could benefit them greatly. We are striving to become a company to aid the less fortunate.</p>
